Description of idea 
Problem: 
1. there are many unprivileged people who do not have access to the food even single times a day.

2.the food from the houses, marriages, and restaurants is wasted everyday which accumulates to to wastage of 92000 crores annually in India.

Solution: FOOD SAVIOURS

Our website FOOD SAVIORS helps to fulfil the need of the hungry people 
across the India. usually in India whenever there is marriage or any party
there is excess food which is left at the end of the function and thrown to
waste. Even in many hotels and restaurants, on daily basis a lot of unconsumed 
food is left which also goes to waste. So, we had come up with its solution
FOOD SAVIOURS which helps in distributing this unconsumed food to the needy people.
user can come to our website and donate the food using it after which our team pick
up's the food and distributes it with help of the NGO's. We either put up a langar of such
food or distribute it using the moving vans.
