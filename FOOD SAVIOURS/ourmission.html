                up to help this world fight against hunger and malnutrition.
                We aim to bring benefits across the spectrum of society and help provide access to food to those who
                don’t have adequate means to access it.</li><br>
            <li><span class="highlight">FOOD SAVIOURS</span> is an organisation which aims to redistribute excess food
                from weddings, parties, events to those who are hungry.</li><br>

            <li><span class="highlight">FOOD SAVIOURS</span> works with Social Responsibility on their minds and with
                the help of other partners and Volunteers we create a local chapter of excess food collection
                institution through our website which in turn is distributed to those who actually need it the most. In
                this way we aim to see a world with zero food waste and no hungry people….</li>
