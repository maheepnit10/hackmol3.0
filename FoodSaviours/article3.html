            India is one of the world’s largest producers of milk & pulses and ranks as the second-largest<br> producer
            of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnut, vegetables, fruits, and cotton, as per the Food<br> and Agriculture
            Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Despite the status, 14 percent of<br> India’s population is
            undernourished, according to ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in<br> the World, 2020.
            The report states 189.2 million people are undernourished in India 34.7<br> percent of the children aged
            under five in India are stunted. 20 percent of India’s children<br> under the age of 5 suffer from wasting,
            meaning their weight is too low for their height.<br><br>

            ‘‘It is unacceptable that hunger is on the rise at a time when the world wastes more than 1<br> billion
            tonnes of food every year. It is time to change how we produce and consume,<br> including to reduce
            greenhouse emissions. Transforming food systems is crucial for<br> delivering all the Sustainable
            Development Goals. As a human family, a world free of hunger<br> is our imperative.’’- Secretary-General
            António Guterres.<br><br>
            Despite adequate food production, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has reported<br> that about 190
            million Indians remain undernourished. Moreover, it states that every third<br> malnourished child is
            Indian.
            Ironically, the same report highlights that around 40% of the<br> food produced in India is either lost or
            wasted. It is further estimated that the value of food<br> wastage in India is around ₹92,000 crores per
            annum.
            This food wastage, however, isn’t<br> limited to one level alone but perforates through every stage; from
            harvesting, processing,<br> packaging, and transporting to the end stage of consumption. Though food wastage
            is
            a<br> global problem, India stands a chance to convert this into an opportunity, if it can address it<br>
            properly.
